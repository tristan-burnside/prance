#Hello world

The most basic program that can be written with prance will just output a static string.

Code:
`print(line: "Hello World")`
Output:
`Hello World`

This uses one of the 2 built in functions of the language `print(line:)`. This function prints to stdout.
The other built in function is scanLine() that waits for a line of input on stdin and returns a string.

Note: to make it easier for others to understand the intent of your code it can be useful
to add inline comments, these start with '//'

```
// Prints out the message 'Hello World' to show the program is running
print(line: "Hello World")
```
